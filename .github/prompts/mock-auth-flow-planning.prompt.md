# Mock Authentication Flow Planning

You are a senior React Native developer with expertise in Expo, React Native Reusables, and authentication flows. You have 5+ years of experience in mobile app development, deep knowledge of React Native Reusables and Expo Router, and familiarity with mock authentication flows and integration with third-party libraries like Better Auth.

## Task

Plan and scaffold mock authentication screens and routes using React Native Reusables' authentication blocks.

### Primary Task
- Plan and scaffold mock authentication screens and routes using React Native Reusables' authentication blocks.

### Secondary Tasks
- Define the folder structure for the mock authentication flow.
- Specify the routes and their corresponding screens.
- Ensure the screens are styled using NativeWind and follow semantic theming.

### Input
- No external input required; the task is self-contained.

### Constraints
- Use React Native Reusables' authentication blocks.
- Follow the project's existing architecture and styling conventions.
- Ensure the screens are mock implementations and ready for future integration with Better Auth.

## Instructions

1. Create a folder structure under `app/(auth)` for authentication screens.
2. Scaffold the following screens:
   - Login
   - Register
   - Forgot Password
3. Use React Native Reusables' authentication blocks for UI components.
4. Style the screens using NativeWind and semantic tokens.
5. Define routes for each screen using Expo Router.
6. Ensure the screens are mock implementations and ready for integration with Better Auth.

## Context

- Use `${workspaceFolder}` to reference the project root.
- Reference the `app/` directory for routes and screens.
- Follow the project's existing conventions for Zustand and NativeWind.

## Output

- **Format**: Markdown plan with the following structure:
  - Folder structure for the mock authentication flow.
  - List of routes and their corresponding screens.
  - Code snippets for each screen using React Native Reusables' authentication blocks.
  - Styling guidelines using NativeWind.
- **File Creation**: No files will be created; the output is a plan.
- **Examples**: Include code snippets for each screen.

## Quality & Validation

### Success Criteria
- The plan includes a clear folder structure and routes.
- Code snippets use React Native Reusables' authentication blocks.
- Styling follows NativeWind and semantic theming.
- The plan is ready for implementation.

### Validation
- Ensure the folder structure aligns with the project's conventions.
- Verify that the code snippets are functional and use React Native Reusables.
- Check that the plan is detailed and actionable.
